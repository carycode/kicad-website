IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a chat system composed of servers and channels that is widespread. Channels are basically "group chats" where multiple users can participate at once.

KiCad has an IRC channel available at link:https://freenode.net/[freenode].

We use the irc://irc.freenode.net/#kicad[#kicad] channel for general discussion. The channel has both developers and general users.

You can use link:https://webchat.freenode.net/[freenode webchat, window="_blank"] if you do not have an IRC client.
